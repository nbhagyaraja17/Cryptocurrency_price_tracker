# Cryptocurrency_price_tracker
Tracks Cryptocurrency value and notifies us through email.
1. Extracted all cryptocurrency data from coindesk website.
2. This is a python code in which user can see real-time price of cryptocurrency value on an interface.
3. User will give a target, if the prices becomes less than target, then user will get an email notification.

Planning to extend this idea to create a website and generate real-time plots, and user can select a particular cryptocurrency and can give target and his/her Email Id to get notification.
